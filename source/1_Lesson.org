- In the early days of computers, graphics were a rare thing.
- Most users interacted with their computers using a terminal, which was only capable of rendering text.
- Because of this, some of the earliest games ever made were purely text-based games, that only used ASCII characters.
[[file:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/17/Rogue_Screen_Shot_CAR.PNG]]
- To this day, many programmers still like to create text-based games. This is especially useful when trying out a knew language, as it let's the programmer play around with the logic of a programming language, without having to worry about the complicated world of rendering graphics.

- One of the most famous of the text-based games was called Rogue.
- Modern games such as Diabolo II are based on Rogue, and creating Rogue-like games is still a challange that many programmers enjoy when trying out a language.
- [[http://jsrogue.com/game][Have a look at this JavaScript implementation of Rogue]], to get a feel for what the game is like.
