- We are going to recreate the game of rock paper scissors in python.
- First let us remind ourselves how the game works.
 - There are 3 possible choices that either player can make:
   - Rock, paper, scissors
 - Rock beats scissors
 - Paper beats rock
 - Scissors beat paper 

** Code It
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- The human will pick their own choice and the computer will pick one at random.
- For the computer to choice at random the python random module must be imported, this is done in the very first line of your code. 
- The possible choices are going to be stored in List – a python data type for holding multiple items.
- The random.randint function will be used to create a random number between 0 and 2.
[[./img/2-1.png]]
- Why 0 to 2?
[[./img/2-2.png]]
- The human will need to be asked for an input to capture their choice.

- There are 9 possible outcomes of the game
Please create a table, link the example below, of all possible outcomes.
[[./img/2-4.png]]
- Now that would be many lines of code but do we need to program all the possible cases?
[[./img/2-5.png]]
- If the computer and human choose the same, it’s a draw
- If the outcome this 1 of the 3 computer win cases, the computer wins
- Else the human must have won.
