- Nim is generally considered to be the first computer game ever created.
- In the 1950s a specialist computer called NIMROD was designed and built just to play the game of Nim.

- This was the Xbox of the 50s.

- Nim is a fairly simple game. Two players take it in turns to remove counters from one of three (or more) heaps.
- The person who removes the last counter is considered the winner (in normal play).
- A typical game of Nim would look something like this...
#+begin_src
|Heap 1|Heap 2|Heap 3|       Move
 
   3      4      5           Bob   takes 2 from A
   1      4      5           Alice takes 3 from C
   1      4      2           Bob   takes 1 from B
   1      3      2           Alice takes 1 from B
   1      2      2           Bob   takes entire A heap, leaving two 2s.
   0      2      2           Alice takes 1 from B
   0      1      2           Bob   takes 1 from C leaving two 1s.
   0      1      1           Alice takes 1 from B
   0      0      1           Bob   takes entire C heap and wins.

- You're going to code a 2 player game of Nim using Python.
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:

- The first couple of lines of code you should be able to handle yourself.
- Use a print statement to tell the players the rules of the game.
- It should read as follows
#+begin_src
Choose a number to move and a heap to move it from, seperated by a space
#+end_src
- Then print an empty line, followed by a third print statement for the heaps.
#+begin_src
|Heap 1|Heap 2|Heap 3|Move
